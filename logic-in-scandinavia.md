### Denmark


Denmark has logic groups primarily working in philosophy and computer science
departments. In philosophy, at University of Copenhagen there is the group of
Vincent Hendricks, at University of Roskilde the group of Patrick Blackburn, and
at Aalborg University the group of Peter Øhrstrøm. Additionally, the philosophy
departments of University of Southern Denmark and Aarhus University has
researchers working in logic. In computer science, there are the sections of
Algorithms, Logic and Graphs (AlgoLoG) and Formal Methods at the Technical
University of Denmark, the group of Carsten Schürmann at the IT University of
Copenhagen, the group Programming, Logic and Intelligent Systems (PLIS) at
Roskilde University, the group Logic and Semantics at Aarhus University, the
research section of Programming Languages and Theory of Computation (PLTC) at
University of Copenhagen, and the group Distributed, Embedded and Intelligent
Systems at Aalborg University. Additionally, the computer science department of
University of Southern Denmark have researchers working in logic. There is
generally fewer logic environments in mathematics in Denmark, though there are
some logicians in mathematics, e.g. Asger Törnquist at the Department of
Mathematics, Copenhagen University.

In Denmark there has been a number of research projects on logic combining
researchers from multiple of the above-mentioned universities and also crossing
the bound between philosophy and computer science departments. We expect to see
more such projects in the future. There has also been a tradition of organising
multi-disciplinary seminar series on logic in the Copenhagen area involving
researchers in computer science and philosophy from Copenhagen University,
Roskilde University and the Technical University of Denmark. The
inter-disciplinary logic community of Copenhagen is informally organised in the
Copenhagen Association for Dynamics, Interaction, Logic, Language and
Computation (CADILLAC): <http://cadillac-dk.weebly.com>.

### Finland

#### Espoo

[The Computational Logic Group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science/computational-logic)
at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University is focused on
developing automated reasoning techniques for solving computational problems in
engineering and science. Their past research has been in the verification and
testing of automation systems and software and in the use of formal methods to
analyze distributed systems. Currently, the research group is researching
efficient computational methods to solve large constraint satisfaction problems.

At the same department, the
[Distributed Algorithms](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/da/)
group conducts research on the foundations of distributed computing. Their focus
is on the locality of computational tasks in large computer networks:
determining which tasks are global, requiring information from the other side of
the network, and which ones are local, only requiring information from a local
neighborhood. Mathematical logic has been applied in the group’s research on
distributed systems.

#### Helsinki

[The Helsinki Logic Group](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/Logic/Home)
at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki is
conducting research on model theory, set theory, finite model theory, as well as
logic and analysis. Their work in logic concerns infinitary logic (especially
transfinite Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games), second order logic, history of logic and
most recently dependence logic. There is a weekly
[Logic Seminar](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/Logic/Seminar)
held on Wednesdays at 12-14.

In the
[Philosophy](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-of-arts/research/disciplines/philosophy-history-and-art/philosophy)
group at the Faculty of Arts,
[Sara Negri](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/people/people-finder/sara-negri-9032085)
has conducted research on philosophical
logic.

Also of interest to logicians is the
[Gödel Enigma](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/godel-enigma),
a research project to study unpublished materials of Kurt Gödel and make them
available to future logicians and philosophers.

#### Lappeenranta

At the School of Engineering Science at LUT University, the
[Fuzzy logic and soft computing](https://www.lut.fi/web/en/school-of-engineering-science/research/research-groups/fuzzy-logic-and-soft-computing)
group studies computational methods used in data analysis with the goal of
creating new methods and tools based on fuzzy set theory. The methods studied
concern classification, feature selection and extraction, as well as fuzzy
principal component analysis. Other research areas include fuzzy linear systems,
fuzzy differential equations and fuzzy multiperson multicriteria decision making
problems.

#### Tampere

The
[Tampere Logic Group](https://research.tuni.fi/logic/)
at Tampere University conducts research in finite model theory and logic in
computer science, different variants of modal logic, team semantics and
dependence logics, as well as many-valued logics. The group is currently engaged
in research projects involving digital forensics and the automation of
mathematical reasoning. The group also runs a a biweekly seminar of logic and
discrete mathematics.

#### Turku

While the University of Turku does not have any research groups focusing on
logic, professor
[Vesa Halava](https://www.utu.fi/en/people/vesa-halava)
has done research on logic concerning the foundations of mathematics.


### Iceland

Logic in Iceland is mainly represented by the Icelandic Center of Excellence in
Theoretical Computer Science (ICE-TCS, <http://www.icetcs.ru.is>) within the
Computer Science department at Reykjavik University. There, a small and young,
but rapidly growing, group of researchers works on equational logic, process
algebra, modal, temporal and epistemic logics, runtime verification, complexity
and logic, type theory, semantics of programming languages and other related
topics. Ongoing projects include one on "Open problems in the equational logic
of processes", a project on "Quantified effects & interaction", and one on
"Epistemic logic for runtime monitoring".

### Norway

Norway has logic groups primarily at the Universities of Bergen and Oslo, but
also in Tromsø.

[The Bergen Logic Group](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/logic)
is a research group at the
[Department of Philosophy](https://www.uib.no/en/fof).
The group's research area includes formal logic (including proof theory, modal
and non-classical logic, and theories of truth), philosophy of logic, theory of
argumentation, and rationality. The group is responsible for several externally
funded research projects and organizes many talks and workshops.

[The Logic, Information and Interaction group](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/lii)
at the University of Bergen is a research group at the
[Department of Information Science and Media Studies](https://www.uib.no/en/infomedia).
The group study formalisation of reasoning about different aspects of
interaction, in particular information change and aggregation. Research areas
include modal logics for reasoning about interaction, such as epistemic-,
action- and game logics, as well as logical formalisation of reasoning about
interaction in other areas of the social sciences such as game theory,
(computational) social choice and social network analysis. The group is very
active in the international community and is responsible for organising the next
Scandinavian Logic Symposium and Nordic Logic School in Bergen in 2021.

There is also a logic cluster in
[Department of Informatics](https://www.uib.no/en/ii)
based in the
[Group on Programming Theory](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/put),
with researchers working especially in mathematical logic and modal logic.

At the University of Oslo, there is research and teaching in logic in the
Departments of
[Mathematics](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/),
[Informatics](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/)
and
[Philosophy](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/).
Topics studied include complexity theory, computability theory, set theory,
reverse mathematics, modal logic, predicativity, paradoxes, the investigation of
algorithms, and applications in the foundations of mathematics and formal
semantics. An overview with further links can be found
[here](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/groups/logic/).

The logic group in Oslo is host to several externally funded research projects
and is responsible for numerous talks and workshops, an annual
[Skolem Lecture](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/groups/logic/events/index.html)
in honour of this great Oslo-based logician, and a weekly
[interdisciplinary seminar in logic](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/research/groups/logic/events/).

There are also logicians based at other universities in and around Oslo:
[Eyvind Briseid](https://www.oslomet.no/om/ansatt/embri/)
and
[Henrik Forssell](https://www.usn.no/english/about/contact-us/employees/henrik-forssell).

At the Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø,
[Michael Morreau](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/person?p_document_id=329116)
does research in philosophical logic and formal epistemology, and
[Jan Harald Alnes](https://uit.no/ansatte/person?p_document_id=42390)
works on philosophical logic and Frege.

### Sweden

#### Gothenburg

Much of the research in the
[Unit of Logic and Types](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/our-research/computing-science/logic-and-types/)
at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering is in the area
intuitionistic type theory and constructive mathematics. Much current work is on
univalent foundations and homotopy type theory. The group is also developing the
proof assistant Agda based on intuitionistic type theory. 

The
[logic group at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science](https://www.logic-gu.se/)
focuses on solving philosophically motivated
questions using tools from mathematical and computational logic in, for
example, the areas of formal theories of truth, metamathematics of foundational
systems, modal logic and dependence logic. The
[research seminar](https://www.logic-gu.se/seminars)
meets biweekly.

#### Stockholm

The main research of the logic group at the
[Department of Philosophy at Stockholm university](https://www.su.se/department-of-philosophy/)
is currently focused on various logical systems for agency and multi-agent
systems, including logics for strategic reasoning and for normative reasoning,
as well as study of fragments of the modal mu-calculus and of transition
semantics for branching time logics. There is a broader scope weekly seminar
series on Logic, Language and Mind, organized by the
[Centre for Logic, Language, and Mind (CLLAM)](https://www.su.se/department-of-philosophy/about-the-department/centres-and-other-units/cllam-1.640497)
at the department.

The
[Stockholm University Department of Mathematics logic group](https://www.su.se/english/research/research-groups/mathematical-logic)
has a long-standing focus on foundations of mathematics, including especially
type theory, constructive mathematics, and categorical logic. There is a weekly
seminar on mathematical logic: <http://logic.math.su.se/seminar/>

At
[the division of theoretical computer science (TCS) at KTH](https://www.kth.se/cs/tcs)
several researchers work on areas involving logic, such as Formal Verification,
Software security, and Provably secure systems. While most of this research uses
or adapts existing logical frameworks for Model checking, Deductive
verification, and Theorem proving, some researchers have also theoretical
contributions to specification languages and verification techniques based on
Temporal logics and variants of Hoare logic. Further, SAT/SMT solving is another
area of interest.

#### Uppsala

The logic group in Uppsala focuses on studying asymptotic properties of classes
of finite structures and on investigating and classifying infinite structures
that are, in one way or other, limits of finite structures, in particular
(ultra)homogeneous structures, or probabilistic limit structures. Often methods
from model theoretic classification theory (stability/simplicity theory) are
used. See the
