### Iceland

Logic in Iceland is mainly represented by the Icelandic Center of Excellence in
Theoretical Computer Science (ICE-TCS, <http://www.icetcs.ru.is>) within the
Computer Science department at Reykjavik University. There, a small and young,
but rapidly growing, group of researchers works on equational logic, process
algebra, modal, temporal and epistemic logics, runtime verification, complexity
and logic, type theory, semantics of programming languages and other related
topics. Ongoing projects include one on "Open problems in the equational logic
of processes", a project on "Quantified effects & interaction", and one on
"Epistemic logic for runtime monitoring".

### Sweden

#### Gothenburg

The
[logic group at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science](https://flov.gu.se/english/research/research-areas/logic)
focuses on solving philosophically motivated
questions using tools from mathematical and computational logic in, for
example, the areas of formal theories of truth, metamathematics of foundational
systems, modal logic and dependence logic. The
[research seminar](https://flov.gu.se/english/research/research-areas/logic/the-logic-seminar)
meets biweekly.

Please also see the webpage of the
[Logic and Types](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/LT/Pages/default.aspx)
group at Chalmers.

#### Stockholm

The main research of the logic group at the Department of Philosophy at
Stockholm university is currently focused on various logical systems for agency
and multi-agent systems, including logics for strategic reasoning and for
normative reasoning, as well as study of fragments of the modal mu-calculus and
of transition semantics for branching time logics. There is a broader scope
weekly seminar series on Logic, Language and Mind, organized by the
[Centre for Logic, Language, and Mind (CLLAM)](https://www.philosophy.su.se/english/research/projects-and-centers/cllam)
at the department.

Please also see the
[Stockholm Logic Seminar](http://logic.math.su.se/seminar)
at the Department of Mathematics.

#### Uppsala

The logic group in Uppsala focuses on studying asymptotic properties of classes
of finite structures and on investigating and classifying infinite structures
that are, in one way or other, limits of finite structures, in particular
(ultra)homogeneous structures, or probabilistic limit structures. Often methods
from model theoretic classification theory (stability/simplicity theory) are
used. See the

for more information.
