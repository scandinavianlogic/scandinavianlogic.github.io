### Denmark


Denmark has logic groups primarily working in philosophy and computer science
departments. In philosophy, at University of Copenhagen there is the group of
Vincent Hendricks, at University of Roskilde the group of Patrick Blackburn, and
at Aalborg University the group of Peter Øhrstrøm. Additionally, the philosophy
departments of University of Southern Denmark and Aarhus University has
researchers working in logic. In computer science, there are the sections of
Algorithms, Logic and Graphs (AlgoLoG) and Formal Methods at the Technical
University of Denmark, the group of Carsten Schürmann at the IT University of
Copenhagen, the group Programming, Logic and Intelligent Systems (PLIS) at
Roskilde University, the group Logic and Semantics at Aarhus University, the
research section of Programming Languages and Theory of Computation (PLTC) at
University of Copenhagen, and the group Distributed, Embedded and Intelligent
Systems at Aalborg University. Additionally, the computer science department of
University of Southern Denmark have researchers working in logic. There is
generally fewer logic environments in mathematics in Denmark, though there are
some logicians in mathematics, e.g. Asger Törnquist at the Department of
Mathematics, Copenhagen University.

In Denmark there has been a number of research projects on logic combining
researchers from multiple of the above-mentioned universities and also crossing
the bound between philosophy and computer science departments. We expect to see
more such projects in the future. There has also been a tradition of organising
multi-disciplinary seminar series on logic in the Copenhagen area involving
researchers in computer science and philosophy from Copenhagen University,
Roskilde University and the Technical University of Denmark. The
inter-disciplinary logic community of Copenhagen is informally organised in the
Copenhagen Association for Dynamics, Interaction, Logic, Language and
Computation (CADILLAC): <http://cadillac-dk.weebly.com>.

### Iceland

Logic in Iceland is mainly represented by the Icelandic Center of Excellence in
Theoretical Computer Science (ICE-TCS, <http://www.icetcs.ru.is>) within the
Computer Science department at Reykjavik University. There, a small and young,
but rapidly growing, group of researchers works on equational logic, process
algebra, modal, temporal and epistemic logics, runtime verification, complexity
and logic, type theory, semantics of programming languages and other related
topics. Ongoing projects include one on "Open problems in the equational logic
of processes", a project on "Quantified effects & interaction", and one on
"Epistemic logic for runtime monitoring".

### Sweden

#### Gothenburg

Much of the research in the
[Division of Logic and Types](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/LT/Pages/default.aspx)
at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering is in the area
intuitionistic type theory and constructive mathematics. Much current work is on
univalent foundations and homotopy type theory. The group is also developing the
proof assistant Agda based on intuitionistic type theory. The group runs a
seminar series entitled
[Initial Types Club](https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club/wiki).

The
[logic group at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science](https://flov.gu.se/english/research/research-areas/logic)
focuses on solving philosophically motivated
questions using tools from mathematical and computational logic in, for
example, the areas of formal theories of truth, metamathematics of foundational
systems, modal logic and dependence logic. The
[research seminar](https://flov.gu.se/english/research/research-areas/logic/the-logic-seminar)
meets biweekly.

#### Stockholm

The main research of the logic group at the
[Department of Philosophy at Stockholm university](https://www.philosophy.su.se/english)
is currently focused on various logical systems for agency and multi-agent
systems, including logics for strategic reasoning and for normative reasoning,
as well as study of fragments of the modal mu-calculus and of transition
semantics for branching time logics. There is a broader scope weekly seminar
series on Logic, Language and Mind, organized by the
[Centre for Logic, Language, and Mind (CLLAM)](https://www.philosophy.su.se/english/research/projects-and-centers/cllam)
at the department.

The
[Stockholm University Department of Mathematics logic group](https://www.math.su.se/english/research/research-groups/research-group-in-mathematical-logic-1.330078)
has a long-standing focus on foundations of mathematics, including especially
type theory, constructive mathematics, and categorical logic. There is a weekly
seminar on mathematical logic: <http://logic.math.su.se/seminar/>

At
[the division of theoretical computer science (TCS) at KTH](https://www.kth.se/tcs)
several researchers work on areas involving logic, such as Formal Verification,
Software security, and Provably secure systems. While most of this research uses
or adapts existing logical frameworks for Model checking, Deductive
verification, and Theorem proving, some researchers have also theoretical
contributions to specification languages and verification techniques based on
Temporal logics and variants of Hoare logic. Further, SAT/SMT solving is another
area of interest.

#### Uppsala

The logic group in Uppsala focuses on studying asymptotic properties of classes
of finite structures and on investigating and classifying infinite structures
that are, in one way or other, limits of finite structures, in particular
(ultra)homogeneous structures, or probabilistic limit structures. Often methods
from model theoretic classification theory (stability/simplicity theory) are
used. See the
