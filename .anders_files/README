Files used by Anders Lundstedt for development and maintenance. Might be of help
to a future developer or maintainer.

- envrc and flake.nix: For running a local development environment using
  nix flakes and direnv.

- css.css.view: my custom vim folds for the css.css file

- _config.yml: extra configuration so that these files do not end up in _site
  (which once caused problems)

- exclude: My ../.git/info/exclude file

- Makefile: Anders' Makefile for this project

- make_symlinks.sh: bash script creating symlinks to the above files
