On 17–18 November 2025, University of Gothenburg will host the 2025 edition of
its annual Lindström Lectures. The Lindström Lectures is a distinguished lecture
series initiated in 2013 celebrating the memory of Per (Pelle) Lindström, former
(and first) professor in logic at the University of Gothenburg.

The 2025 edition of
[The Lindström Lectures](https://logic-gu.se/lindstrom-lectures/)
will be delivered 17–18 November 2025 by Jouko Väänänen, Professor of
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki and the Institute for Logic, Language
and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. See
[the webpage](https://logic-gu.se/lindstrom-lectures/the-lindstrom-lectures-2025/)
of the 2025 edition for more information.

*On the Logic of Dependence*

### Abstract
Dependence and independence concepts are ubiquitous in natural science, social
science, humanities as well as in everyday life. The sentences “I park on this
side of the road depending only on the day of the week” and “the time of descent
is independent of the weight of the object” are examples of this. The question
arises, do these concepts possess enough exactness for us to investigate their
logic? There is currently a whole literature on this topic. It is the purpose of
this talk to give a non-technical overview of this area of logic.

*In Search of New Lindström Theorems*  

### Abstract

The combination of Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem and Compactness Theorem limits the
expressive power of a logic to that of first order logic. This maximality
principle is the famous Lindström Theorem for first order logic. It reveals that
first order logic is at an optimal point of balance: by adding expressive power
to it one necessarily loses model-theoretic properties. Soon after Lindström’s
result, the question was raised, whether there are other logics at a similar
point of equilibrium. More precisely: are there strict strengthenings of first
order logic satisfying a Lindström-type characterization? Despite the naturality
of this question, it remained unanswered, until recently.

In 2012 Saharon Shelah offered a solution to this problem in the form of a new
infinitary logic. It has a Lindström-type characterization in terms of
model-theoretic properties combining weak forms of Compactness and a
Löwenheim-Skolem type property. In all known cases, a proof of a Lindström-type
characterization automatically gives a proof of Craig Interpolation. This is the
case for Shelah’s logic, too. There is, however, one aspect where Shelah’s logic
seems to be rather weak: the syntax. The logic is derived from a game, in the
sense that a sentence is, by definition, a class of structures, closed under a
certain Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé type of a game. This results in the absence of a
syntax defined in such a way that the set of all formulas could be obtained by
closing the set of atomic formulas under negation, conjunction, quantifiers, and
possibly other logical operations. The lack of syntax complicates further study
of it and logics in its neighborhood. In the present talk, we address the
general question of deriving a syntax from a game, and the more localized
question of finding a syntax for Shelah’s logic. Partial answers are provided to
both questions. This is joint work with Andres Villaveces and Siiri Kivimäki.
