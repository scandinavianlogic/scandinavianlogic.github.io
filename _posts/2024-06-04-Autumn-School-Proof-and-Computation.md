[Second call for applications]

Autumn school "Proof and Computation"  
Fischbachau, Germany, 15th to 21st September 2024  
<http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/pc24.php>

This year's international autumn school "Proof and Computation" will be held
from 15th to 21st September 2024 in Fischbachau near Munich. Its aim is to bring
together young researchers in the field of Foundations of Mathematics, Computer
Science and Philosophy.

### SCOPE
- Predicative Foundations
- Constructive Mathematics and Type Theory
- Computation in Higher Types
- Extraction of Programs from Proofs

### COURSES
- Thierry Coquand (Gothenburg): Topos theory and constructive mathematics
- Klaus Mainzer (Munich): From Proof and Computation to AI - Logical,
  Mathematical, and Philosophical Foundations
- Gerhard Jäger (Bern): Foundations of explicit mathematics
- Sara Negri (Genoa): Enriched syntax for enhanced proof theory
- Monika Seisenberger (Swansea): Extraction of programs from proofs
- Holger Thies (Kyoto): Extracting efficient programs from proofs in analysis
- Freek Wiedijk (Nijmegen): The De Bruijn criterion versus the Poincare principle

### WORKING GROUPS
There will be an opportunity to form ad-hoc groups working on specific projects,
but also to discuss in more general terms the vision of constructing correct
programs from proofs.

### APPLICATIONS
Graduate or PhD students and young postdoctoral researchers are invited to
apply. Applications (e.g. a self-introduction including research interests and
motivation) should be sent to

Chuangjie Xu <xu@math.lmu.de>.

Students are required to provide also a letter of recommendation, preferably
from the thesis adviser.

Please specify in your application whether you are interested in applying for
financial support (details provided below).

Deadline for applications: **7th June 2024**.

Applicants will be notified by 24th June 2024.

### FINANCIAL SUPPORT

Successful applicants are eligible to apply for financial support that covers
accommodation and meals for the duration of the autumn school. Information about
funding application will be provided to the selected candidates.

The workshop is supported by the Udo Keller Stiftung (Hamburg) and the COST
Action EuroProofNet <https://europroofnet.github.io>.
