HELSINKI, 17 AUGUST -- 21 AUGUST 2020

<https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/advances-in-modal-logic-2020>

Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting the state of the
art in modal logic and its various applications. The initiative consists of a
conference series together with volumes based on the conferences. Information
about the AiML series can be obtained at <http://www.aiml.net>

AiML 2020 is the 13th conference in the series.

TOPICS

We invite submissions on all aspects of modal logic, including:

- history of modal logic
- philosophy of modal logic
- applications of modal logic
- automated reasoning for modal logics
- computational aspects of modal logic (complexity and decidability of modal and
  temporal logics, model checking, model generation)
- theoretical aspects of modal logic (topological/algebraic/categorical
  perspectives on modal logic, co-algebraic modal logic, completeness and
  canonicity, correspondence and duality theory, many-dimensional modal logics,
  modal fixed-point logics, model theory of modal logic, proof theory of modal
  logic)
- specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics, modal
  logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process logics,
  epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based systems, modal
  logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar formalisms, provability and
  interpretability logics, conditional logics, spatial and temporal logics,
  hybrid logic, intuitionistic (modal) logics, intermediate logics, bunched
  implication and separation logics)

Papers on related subjects will also be considered.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS

There will be two types of submissions for AiML 2020:

(1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the
conference.

(2) Short presentations intended for presentation at the conference but not for
the published proceedings.

Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair
submission page at: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2020>

At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register
for and attend the conference.

(1) FULL PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and
publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research and
not submitted elsewhere. The proceedings of AiML 2020 will be published by
College Publications (<http://www.collegepublications.co.uk>) in a volume to be
made available at the conference.

The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical appendix
of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The
submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the style files and template that
will be provided on the AiML 2020 website:
<https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/advances-in-modal-logic-2020> in due
time.

Authors must submit an abstract in plain text via EasyChair by the abstract
deadline prior to full submission of their paper.

The presentations of accepted full papers will be 30 minutes long.

(2) SHORT PRESENTATIONS.

These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary results, work in
progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The accepted submissions
will be made available at the conference, and the authors will have the
opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on them.
