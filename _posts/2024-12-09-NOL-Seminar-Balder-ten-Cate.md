[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Date**    Monday, 23 December 2024 at 16:00 CET (UTC+1) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Balder ten Cate (Associate Professor, University of Amsterdam)  
**Title**   Preservation theorems for binary relation algebras

**Abstract**  
Several areas of computer science (databases, knowledge representation, program
verification, reasoning about knowledge and actions) feature logical languages
in which one can construct complex binary relations from basic ones, through a
certain set of operations (e.g., relational composition, union, inverse, …).
Examples include propositional dynamic logics such as PDL and KAT (Kleene
Algebra with Tests) as well as various query languages for graph databases.
Underlying each of these is a “binary relation algebra” , i.e., an algebraic
signature consisting of finitely many operations on binary relations. The
specific set of operators, in each of the aforementioned languages, is typically
chosen as a compromise between computational complexity and expressive power
and/or may be based on a requirement to preserve certain natural structural
properties such as functionality or bisimulation.

Preservation theorems link semantics properties of formulas to their syntactic
shape. The most famous example is the Łoś-Tarski theorem, which states that a
first-order formula is preserved under induced substructures (i.e., remains true
if one passes from a structure to an induced substructure) if and only if it can
be written without using any existential quantifiers (assuming negation normal
form). In this talk, we will review some recent results (both positive and
negative) about the existence of preservation theorems for algebras of binary
relations. (Algebraically, the results I will present can be equivalently viewed
as addressing the question whether certain clones admit a finite set of
generators).

Specifically, I will discuss results about Tarski’s relation algebra from a
joint paper with Bart Bogaerts, Brett McLean, and Jan van den Bussche (LMCS
2024) as well as results about Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) from a joint
paper with Tobias Kappé (POPL 2025).
