**Date**    Monday, 25 November 2024 at 17:00 CET (UTC+1) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Wesley Holliday (Professor of Philosophy, UC Berkeley)  
**Title**   From constructive mathematics and quantum mechanics to Fundamental Logic

**Abstract**  
Non-classical logics have been proposed in a number of domains, including
constructive mathematics and quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will identify a
base logic beneath some of these non-classical logics that I suggest has a
certain fundamental status. I will give an introduction to the proof theory and
semantics of this “Fundamental Logic.”
