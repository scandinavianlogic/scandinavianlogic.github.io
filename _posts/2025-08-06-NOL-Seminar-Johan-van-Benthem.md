**Title** Building Modern Modal Logic: Honoring Krister Segerberg

**Abstract**  
Krister Segerberg was one of the architects of modal logic as we know it today.
I will highlight a few of his major contributions and show some of their
subsequent impact in various academic communities. I conclude with some thoughts
on the blend of philosophical logic and formal philosophy embodied in Kristerâ€™s
distinguished career.
