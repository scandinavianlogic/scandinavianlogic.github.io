Logics of dependence and independence are novel non-classical logics aiming at
characterizing dependence and independence notions in sciences. This field of
research has grown rapidly in recent years. The framework of the logics has
found applications also in fields like database theory, linguistics, social
choice, quantum physics and so on. This workshop will bring together researchers
from all these relevant areas and provide a snapshot of the state of the art of
logics of dependence and independence.
