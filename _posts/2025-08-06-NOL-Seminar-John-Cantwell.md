**Date** Monday, 25 August 2025 at 16:00 CEST (UTC+2) on Zoom  
**Speaker** John Cantwell, Professor of Philosophy at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden  
**Title** Some reflections on Krister’s philosophy of philosophy

**Abstract**  
In this talk I will briefly outline Krister’s biography, focusing mainly on the
early nineties onwards when I became Krister’s first PhD student. By appeal
(mostly) to anecdote I will try to highlight what I take to be some of the most
notable features in Krister’s approach to and views on pilosophically inspired
logical research and education.
