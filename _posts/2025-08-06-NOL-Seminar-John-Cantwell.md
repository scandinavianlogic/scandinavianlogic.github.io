The next NOL seminar event will be devoted to a memorial session for Krister
Segerberg, who passed away in January.

**Date** Monday, 25 August 2025 at 16:00 CEST (UTC+2) on Zoom

There will be two speakers. This is the
announcement for the first talk, by John Cantwell.
[The second talk](/2025-08-06-NOL-Seminar-Johan-van-Benthem.html)
is given by Johan van Benthem.

**Speaker** John Cantwell, Professor of Philosophy at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden  
**Title** Some reflections on Krister’s philosophy of philosophy

**Abstract**  
In this talk I will briefly outline Krister’s biography, focusing mainly on the
early nineties onwards when I became Krister’s first PhD student. By appeal
(mostly) to anecdote I will try to highlight what I take to be some of the most
notable features in Krister’s approach to and views on pilosophically inspired
logical research and education.
