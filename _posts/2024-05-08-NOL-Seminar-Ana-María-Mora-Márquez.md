**Speaker:** Ana María Mora-Márquez (Researcher and Wallenberg Academy Fellow,

**Title:** Medieval Aristotelian Logic is Scientific Method

**Abstract:**  
This presentation aims to show that medieval Aristotelian logic can be generally
characterized as scientific method. To be sure, this method includes formal
logic as one of its parts, but formal logic is by no means the crucial part. In
fact, if, as I intend to show, the main aim of medieval Aristotelian logic is to
provide methods for knowledge production and distribution, so its crucial parts
are the methods for scientific proof provided in commentaries on Aristotle’s
Posterior Analytics and Topics.

In the first part of the presentation, I argue for the possibility of talking of
medieval ‘science’, ‘scientific knowledge’, and ‘scientific method’ from a
modern perspective, and discuss how the modern perspective relates to the Latin
‘scientia’ in its different senses. In the second part, I show the progression
from Nicholas of Paris (1240s) and Albert the Great (1250s), who see
Aristotelian logic as a systematic scientific method where syllogistic argument
is fundamental, but who struggle to coherently organize it around syllogistic
argument, to Radulphus Brito (1290s) who, still seeing Aristotelian logic as
scientific method, uses the notion of ‘second intention’ in order to coherently
structure it around syllogistic argument.
