### Description
This workshop celebrates the past 30 years of active research in the area of
Finite Model Theory (FMT) in Finland. Research in FMT in Finland began due to
joint efforts of Phokion G. Kolaitis and Jouko Väänänen in the end of 1980's.
The concrete starting point for research among the Finnish logicians was the
keynote lecture of Kolaitis at Logic Colloquium 1990 and a summer school in FMT
held in 1991.
