**Date** Monday, 16 March 2026 at 16:00 CET (UTC+1) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Yiannis Moschovakis (Professor of Mathematics Emeritus, University of Athens and UCLA)  
**Title**  Intensional semantics for formal and programming languages  

**Abstract**  
The claim is that intensions (or meanings) can be modeled usefully by algorithms
which compute truth values, proofs (in various systems), denotations and
implementations of programs (in various programming languages), etc.. I will
discuss the nature of these ‘algorithms’ and present some unpublished results by
me and others on this topic. Most of what I will say is in the book [1] which
contains many unpublished results by Lou van den Dries, Vaughn Pratt, Anush
Tserunyan and others.
