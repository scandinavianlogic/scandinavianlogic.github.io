**Date** Monday, 3 June 2024 at 16:00 CEST (UTC+2) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Ivano Ciardelli (Associate Professor of Logic, University of Padua)  
**Title** Inquisitive modal logic: an overview

**Abstract**  
Inquisitive modal logic is a generalization of standard modal logic where the
language also contains questions, and modal operators that can be applied to
them. In this talk, I will provide an introductory overview of inquisitive modal
logic. I will review some motivations for the approach, present some prominent
examples of inquisitive modal logics, mention some results about them, and
outline directions for future work.
