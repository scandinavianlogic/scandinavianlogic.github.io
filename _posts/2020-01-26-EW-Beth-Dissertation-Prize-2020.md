Since 2002, the Association for Logic, Language, and Information (FoLLI) has
been awarding the annual E.W. Beth Dissertation Prize to outstanding Ph.D.
dissertations in Logic, Language, and Information
(<http://www.folli.info/?page_id=74>), with financial support of the E.W. Beth
Foundation
(<https://www.knaw.nl/en/awards/funds/evert-willem-beth-stichting/evert-willem-beth-foundation>).
Nominations are now invited for the best dissertation in these areas resulting
in a Ph.D. degree awarded in 2019.

The deadline for nominations is the 15th of April 2020.

Qualifications:

- A dissertation is eligible for the Beth Dissertation Prize 2020, if the Ph.D.
  degree has been awarded in Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st
  and December 31st, 2019.

- There are no restrictions on the nationality, ethnicity, age, gender or
  employment status of the author of the nominated dissertation, nor on the
  university, academic department or scientific institution formally conferring
  the Ph.D. degree, nor on the language in which the dissertation has originally
  been written.

- In accordance with the aim of the Beth Foundation to continue and extend the
  work of the Dutch logician Evert Willem Beth, nominations are invited of

  philosophy in general, as well as the current theoretical and foundational

  Dissertations with results more broadly impacting various research areas in
  their interdisciplinary investigations are especially solicited.

- If a nominated dissertation has originally been written in a language other than English, its dossier should still contain the required 10 page English abstract, see below. If the committee decides that a nominated dissertation in a language other than English requires translation to English for proper evaluation, the committee can transfer its nomination to the competition in 2021. The English translation must in such cases be submitted before the deadline of the call for nominations in 2021. The committee may recommend the Beth Foundation to consider supporting such nominated dissertations for English translation, upon request by the author of the dissertation.

The prize consists of:
