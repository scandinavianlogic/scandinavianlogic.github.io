On Thursday, 11 May and on Friday, 12 May, the University of Gothenburg is
hosting the 2023 edition of its annual Lindström Lectures. The Lindström
Lectures is a distinguished lecture series initiated in 2013 celebrating the
memory of Per (Pelle) Lindström, former (and first) professor in logic at the
university. For information about the Lindström lecture series see:

The 2023 Lindström Lectures will be delivered by Rineke Verbrugge, Professor of
Logic and Cognition at the Bernoulli Institute of Mathematics, Computer Science
and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen.

- *Title*: Combining probability and provability logic

#### Abstract
It has been shown in the late 1960s that each formula of first-order logic
without constants and function symbols obeys a zero-one law: As the number of
elements of finite models increases, every formula holds either in almost all or
in almost no models of that size. For modal logics, limit behavior for models
and frames may differ. In 1994, Halpern and Kapron proved zero-one laws for
classes of models corresponding to the modal logics K, T, S4, and S5. They also
proposed zero-one laws for the corresponding classes of frames, but their
zero-one law for K-frames has since been disproved, and so has more recently
their zero-one law for S4-frames. Provability logic was one of the main
interests of Per Lindström. In this talk, we prove zero-one laws for provability
logic with respect to both model and frame validity. Moreover, we axiomatize
validity in almost all irreflexive transitive finite models and in almost all
irreflexive transitive finite frames, leading to two different axiom systems. In
the proofs, we use a combinatorial result by Kleitman and Rothschild about the
structure of finite (strict) partial orders: almost all of them consist of only
three layers. Finally, we present empirical results in order to give an idea of
the number of elements from which onwards a formula’s almost sure validity or
almost sure invalidity stabilizes in such three-layer Kleitman-Rothschild
frames. We also discuss possible extensions of the zero-one laws to the modal
logics S4 and K4.

### Research Lindström Lecture 2023
- *Date and time*: Friday, 12 May 2023 at 10:00 (CEST)
- *Location*: Faculty of Humanities, University of Gothenburg
- *Title*: Aspects of provability and interpretability

#### Abstract
In 1994, Rineke Verbrugge did a postdoc in Gothenburg, as a scientific guest of
Professor Per Lindström, who was writing his landmark book Aspects of
Incompleteness at the time. Even though the two of them did not co-author any
papers that year, there was still significant mutual influence and there were
very lively discussions in the weekly seminars of the logic group. In this
research lecture, Rineke Verbrugge will present some of the questions and
results around bounded arithmetic, provability and interpretability logic that
she was working on that year, for example, a small reflection principle for
bounded arithmetic and the lattice of feasible interpretability types.
