[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

Title: On the proof theoretic strength of cyclic reasoning

Speaker: Anupam Das, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham

Abstract:

Cyclic (or circular) proofs are now a common technique for demonstrating
metalogical properties of systems incorporating (co)induction, including modal
logics, predicate logics, type systems and algebras. Inspired by automaton
theory, cyclic proofs encode a form of self-dependency of which
induction/recursion comprise special cases. An overarching question of the area,
the so-called 'Brotherston-Simpson conjecture', asks to what extent the converse
holds.

In this talk I will discuss a line of work that attempts to understand the
expressivity of circular reasoning via forms of proof theoretic strength.
Namely, I address predicate logic in the guise of first-order arithmetic, and
type systems in the guise of higher-order primitive recursion, and establish a
recurring theme: circular reasoning buys precisely one level of 'abstraction'
over inductive reasoning.

This talk will be based on the following works:
