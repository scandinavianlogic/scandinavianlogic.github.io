A description of our research section can be found here:
<https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/algolog>.
We do research in algorithms, logic and graph theory (as suggested by the title
of our section), and how to apply these within artificial intelligence,
knowledge representation, human-robot interaction, efficient software for large
data sets and more. 

Further information can be obtained from the head of section, Paul Fischer
(pafi@dtu.dk). I’m myself in particular representing the logic-based AI part of
the section, together with Jørgen Villadsen and Nina Gierasimczuk, and you’re
also welcome to contact me regarding our activities and interests in that area.

Best,

Thomas Bolander
