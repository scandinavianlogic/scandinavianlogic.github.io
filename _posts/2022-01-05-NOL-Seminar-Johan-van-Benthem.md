Title: Interleaving Logic and Counting

Speaker: Johan van Benthem, Professor of Logic at the University of Amsterdam,
Stanford University, and Tsinghua University

Abstract:

Reasoning with generalized quantifiers in natural language combines logical and
arithmetical features, transcending divides between qualitative and
quantitative. This practice blends with inference patterns in ‘grassroots
mathematics’ such as pigeon-hole principles. Our topic is this cooperation of
logic and counting on a par, studied with small systems and gradually moving
upward. We start with monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide normal
forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical notions are
definable, and conversely, discuss which logical notions and reasoning
principles can be defined out of arithmetical ones. Next we study a series of
strengthenings in the same style, including second-order versions, systems with
multiple counting, and a new modal logic with counting. As a complement to our
fragment approach, we also discuss another way of controlling complexity:
changing the semantics of counting to reason about ‘mass’ or other aggregating
notions than cardinalities. Finally, we return to the basic reasoning practices
that lie embedded in natural language, confronting our formal systems with
linguistic quantifier vocabulary, monotonicity reasoning, and procedural
semantics via semantic automata. We conclude with some pointers to further
entanglements of logic and counting in the metamathematics of formal systems,
the philosophy of logic, and cognitive psychology.
