Title: **On Weyl's predicative concept of set**  
Speaker: **Laura Crosilla**, Researcher, University of Oslo  

Abstract:

In the book Das Kontinuum (1918), Hermann Weyl presents a coherent and
sophisticated approach to analysis from a predicativist perspective. In the
first chapter of (Weyl 1918), Weyl introduces a predicative concept of set,
according to which sets are built ‘from the bottom up’ starting from the natural
numbers. Weyl clearly contrasts this predicative concept of set with the concept
of arbitrary set, which he finds wanting, especially when working with infinite
sets. In the second chapter of Das Kontinuum, he goes on to show that large
portions of 19th century analysis can be developed on the basis of his
predicative concept of set.Das Kontinuum inspired fundamental ideas in
mathematical logic and beyond, such as the logical analysis of predicativity of
the 1950-60’s, Solomon Feferman’s work on predicativity and Errett Bishop’s
constructive mathematics. The seeds of Das Kontinuum are already visible in the
early (Weyl 1910), where Weyl, among other things, offers a clarification of
Zermelo’s axiom schema of Separation.In this talk, I examine Weyl’s predicative
concept of set in (Weyl 1918) and discuss its origins in (Weyl 1910).
