[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Speaker**:  Peter Pagin, Professor Emeritus at the Department of Philosophy at
Stockholm University  
**Title**: Switcher Semantics and quantification  
**Abstract**:  
Switcher Semantics is a semantic framework that is basically characterised by
allowing *switching*: when recursively applying a semantic function *μ* to a
complex term *t*, the semantic function applying to an immediate subterm *t'* of
*t* may be a function *μ'*, distinct from *μ*. An operator-argument-position
pair is called a *switcher* if it induces such a switch. Switcher semantic
systems do not satisfy the standard form of compositionality, but a generalized
form, which allows greater flexibility. In earlier work (mostly published), some
together with Kathrin Glüer, some with Dag Westerståhl, it has been applied to
natural language constructions like proper names in modal contexts, general
terms in modal contexts, indexicals in temporal contexts, quotation, and belief
contexts. This talk will focus on quantifiers and quantification. First-order
quantifiers can be regarded as switchers, switching from truth conditions to
satisfaction conditions. The larger topic is quantification into switched
contexts. I shall begin by giving an introduction to the framework.
