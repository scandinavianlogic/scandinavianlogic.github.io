Title: Reading syntax off semantics

Speaker: Juliette Kennedy, Associate professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki

Abstract:  
The practice of foundations of mathematics is built around a firm distinction
between syntax and semantics. But how stable is this distinction, and is it
always the case that semantically presented mathematical objects in the form
e.g. of a model class might give rise to a "natural logic"? In this talk I will
investigate different scenarios from set and model theory in which an
investigation of the notion of an implicit or internal logic or syntax becomes
possible. Time permitting we will also discuss the question whether logics
without a syntax can be considered logics at all.
