[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Date**: Monday, 27 November, 2023, during 15:00–16:30 CET (UTC+1) on
Zoom  
**Speaker:** Sonja Smets, professor in Logic and Epistemology at the Institute
for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam  
**Title:** Reasoning about Epistemic Superiority and Data Exchange

**Abstract**  
In this presentation I focus on a framework that generalizes dynamic epistemic
logic in order to model a wider range of scenarios including those in which
agents read or communicate (or somehow gain access to) all the information
stored at specific sources, or possessed by some other agents (including
information of a non-propositional nature, such as data, passwords, secrets
etc). The resulting framework allows one to reason about the state of affairs in
which one agent (or group of agents) has ‘epistemic superiority’ over another
agent (or group). I will present different examples of epistemic superiority and
I will draw a connection to the logic of functional dependence by A. Baltag and
J. van Benthem. At the level of group attitudes, I will further introduce the
new concept of 'common distributed knowledge', which combines features of both
common knowledge and distributed knowledge. This presentation is based on joint
work with A. Baltag in [1].
