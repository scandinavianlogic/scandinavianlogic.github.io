Title: Validity of inference and argument

Speaker: Dag Prawitz, Stockholm University

Abstract:

An account of inferences should take into account not only inferences from
established premisses but also inferences made under assumptions. This makes it
necessary to consider arguments, chains of inferences in which assumptions and
variables may become bound. An argument is valid when all its inferences are
valid, and it then amounts to a proof in case it has no unbound assumptions or
variables. The validity of an inference – not to confuse with the conclusion
being a logical consequence of the premisses – seems in turn best explained in
terms of proofs. This means that the concepts of valid inference and valid
argument depend on each other and cannot be defined independently but have to be
described by principles that state how they are related. A number of such
principles will be proposed.  It is conjectured that inferences that can be
expressed in the language of first order intuitionistic predicate logic and are
implied to be valid by these principles are all provable in that logic.
