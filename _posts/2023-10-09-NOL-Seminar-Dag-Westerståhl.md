**Date** Monday, 30 October 2023, at 16:00 CET (UTC+1) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Dag Westerståhl (Stockholm University, Tsinghua University)  
**Title** From consequence to meaning: the case of intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL)

**Abstract**  
One quarter of the talk presents background on how facts about entailments and
non-entailments can single out the constants in a language, and in particular on
an idea originating with Carnap that the standard relation of logical
consequence in a formal language should fix the (model-theoretic) meaning of its
logical constants. Carnap’s focus was classical propositional logic (CPL), but
his question can be asked for any logical language. The rest of the talk gives a
very general positive answer to this question for IPL: the usual IPL consequence
relation does indeed determine the standard intuitionistic meaning of the
propositional connectives, according to most well-known semantics for IPL, such
as Kripke semantics, Beth semantics, Dragalin semantics, topological semantics,
and algebraic semantics.
