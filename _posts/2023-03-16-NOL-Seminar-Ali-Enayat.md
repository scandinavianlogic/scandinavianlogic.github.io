**Date** Monday, 27 March 2023 at 16:00 (CEST), over Zoom  
**Speaker** Ali Enayat (Emeritus Professor, University of Gothenburg)  
**Title** Arithmetic and set theory through the lens of interpretability  
**Abstract** The notion of (relative) interpretation for first order theories
was introduced in a landmark 1953 monograph by Alfred Tarski, Andrzej Mostowski
and Raphael Robinson, where it was developed as a powerful tool for establishing
undecidability results. By now the domain of interest and applicability of
interpretability theory far exceeds undecidability theory owing to its
multifaceted interactions with both proof theory and model theory. Special
attention will be paid to recent advances in the subject that indicate the
distinctive character of Peano Arithmetic, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and
their higher order analogues in the realm of interpretability theory. This talk
will present a personal overview of the interpretability analysis of
arithmetical and set theoretical theories.
