title: "Five years of the Nordic Online Logic Seminar"
---
Next month marks the 5 year anniversary of the Nordic Logic Seminar! What began
as an antidote to the travel restrictions of COVID attracted a considerably
larger following than we could imagine. Since March 2021 we have enjoyed 48 NOL
seminars and 4 Lindström Lectures. Val and I would like to take this opportunity
to thank all our speakers so far and, of course, all our subscribers for the
continued interest and support. And to forestall any speculation, we have no
plans to stop!
