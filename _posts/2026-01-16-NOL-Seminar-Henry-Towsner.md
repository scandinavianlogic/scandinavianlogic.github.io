**Speaker** Henry Towsner (Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania)  
**Title** What proofs can be

**Abstract**  
Throughout proof theory, proofs are often taken to be well-founded (often
finite) trees of inferences. Theories of inductive definitions, among other
theories, bump up against the limitations of this perspective, and a variety of
formalisms have been used to push beyond this - Girard's beta-proofs,
non-well-founded proofs, proofs-as-functions. We briefly describe some features
of these approaches, the way these perspectives are essentially equivalent, and
the way well-foundedness reasserts itself as a core property of proofs.
