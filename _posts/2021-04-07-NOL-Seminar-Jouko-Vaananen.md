Title: Dependence logic: Some recent developments  
Speaker: Jouko Väänänen, University of Helsinki


Abstract: In the traditional so-called Tarski’s Truth Definition the semantics
of first order logic is defined with respect to an assignment of values to the
free variables. A richer family of semantic concepts can be modelled if
semantics is defined with respect to a set (a “team”) of such assignments. This
is called team semantics. Examples of semantic concepts available in team
semantics but not in traditional Tarskian semantics are the concepts of
dependence and independence. Dependence logic is an extension of first-order
logic based on team semantics. It has emerged that teams appear naturally in
several areas of sciences and humanities, which has made it possible to apply
dependence logic and its variants to these areas. In my talk I will give a quick
introduction to the basic ideas of team semantics and dependence logic as well
as an overview of some new developments, such as quantitative analysis of team
properties, a framework for a multiverse approach to set theory, and
probabilistic independence logic inspired by the foundations of quantum
mechanics.
