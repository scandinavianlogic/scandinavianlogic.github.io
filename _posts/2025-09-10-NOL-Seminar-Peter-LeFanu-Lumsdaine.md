**Title** Getting rich but staying weak: Usable foundational systems for finitistic mathematics

**Abstract**  
There is a long tradition of distinguishing finistic methods of reasoning, for
both philosophical and mathematical motivations. Typically, this is made precise
by reducing arguments to some theory of arithmetic – usually Peano or Heyting
Arithmetic, or weaker fragments thereof. However, working directly in such
systems requires encoding all objects as numbers; it is easy to get the
impression that such coding is an inherent and inevitable aspect of the topic.
On the contrary, most major foundational logics – in particular, ZF-style set
theory and dependent type theories – admit finitistic variants, equivalent in
strength to suitable systems of arithmetic. These allow us to work rigorously in
a finististic foundation, while keeping the richly expressive language we’re
used to from everyday mathematics. I will survey various finitistic systems, and
then focus in more detail on the categorical Arithmetic Universes of Joyal, and
type theories for these, following Maietti.
