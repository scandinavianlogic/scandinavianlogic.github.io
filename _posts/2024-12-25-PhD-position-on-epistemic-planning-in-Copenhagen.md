### PhD scholarship in Epistemic Planning (Logic and AI) – DTU Compute, Copenhagen, Denmark.

DTU (Technical University of Denmark) is offering a PhD scholarship in logic and
AI within the research project Attention in Epistemic Planning. The project
members are Gaia Belardinelli (Stanford University), Thomas Bolander (PI, DTU),
Hans van Ditmarsch (IRIT Toulouse), Hermine Grosinger (Örebro University), Jens
Ulrik Hansen (Roskilde University), Nir Lipovetzky (University of Melbourne),
Rineke Verbrugge (University of Groningen) and Sebastian Watzl (University of
Oslo). Your principal supervisor will by Thomas Bolander.

Short project description: The project takes departure in epistemic planning
based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), a line of research within symbolic AI
initiated by the PI in 2011. It allows agents, e.g. robots, to reason about
other agents, e.g. humans, as part of their planning process. The crucial
novelty of the proposed project is to develop and integrate logical models of
attention with the aim of 1) achieving better computational complexity and
practical efficiency; 2) allow robots to reason about the limited attention of
humans. The project will take inspiration from theories of human attention from
philosophy and cognitive science and build models of dynamic epistemic logic
that represent crucial aspects of attention, including its boundedness, its
selectiveness, and the distinction between top-down and bottom-up attention. The
main formalisms and algorithms developed will be based on dynamic epistemic
logic that will both be investigated theoretically and implemented in a robotic
setup.

#### Responsibilities and qualifications

Your job will be to:

* assist in developing formal logical models of attention, using mainly dynamic
  epistemic logic (DEL);
* assist in developing theoretical frameworks, algorithms and implementations of
  attention-based epistemic planning, and investigate the (theoretical and
  practical) efficiency of the developed algorithms;
* be main responsible for implementing attention-based epistemic planning in
  multi-agent simulations and humanoid robots, and evaluate the dynamics and
  quality of agent interactions (including human-robot interaction).
