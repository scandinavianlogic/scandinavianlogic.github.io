Title: John Eliot’s Logick Primer: A bilingual English-Wôpanâaak logic textbook

Speaker: Sara L. Uckelman, Associate professor at the Department of Philosophy, Durham University

Abstract:

In 1672 John Eliot, English Puritan educator and missionary, published The
Logick Primer: Some Logical Notions to initiate the INDIANS in the knowledge of
the Rule of Reason; and to know how to make use thereof [1]. This roughly 80
page pamphlet focuses on introducing basic syllogistic vocabulary and reasoning
so that syllogisms can be created from texts in the Psalms, the gospels, and
other New Testament books. The use of logic for proselytizing purposes is not
distinctive: What is distinctive about Eliot’s book is that it is bilingual,
written in both English and Wôpanâak (Massachusett), an Algonquian language
spoken in eastern coastal and southeastern Massachusetts. It is one of the
earliest bilingual logic textbooks, it is the only textbook that I know of in an
indigenous American language, and it is one of the earliest printed attestations
of the Massachusett language.


In this talk, I will:

• Introduce John Eliot and the linguistic context he was working in.  
• Introduce the contents of the Logick Primer—vocabulary, inference patterns,
and applications.  
• Discuss notions of “Puritan” logic that inform this primer.  
• Talk about the importance of his work in documenting and expanding the
Massachusett language and the problems that accompany his colonial approach to
this work.
