**Date** Monday, 27 February 2023 at 16:00 (CET), over Zoom  
**Speaker** Sven Ove Hansson (Professor of Philosophy, KTH)  
**Title** How to combine probabilities and full beliefs in a formal system  
**Abstract** One of the major problems in formal epistemology is the difficulty
of combining probabilistic and full (dichotomous, all-or-nothing) beliefs in one
and the same formal framework. Major properties of actual human belief systems,
including how they are impacted by our cognitive limitations, are used to
introduce a series of desiderata for realistic models of such belief systems.
This leads to a criticism of previous attempts to combine representations of
both  probabilistic and full beliefs in one and the same formal model.
Furthermore, a formal model is presented in which this is done differently. One
of its major features is that contingent propositions can be transferred in both
directions between full beliefs and lower degrees of belief, in a way that
mirrors real-life acquisitions and losses of full beliefs. The subsystem
consisting of full beliefs has a pattern of change that constitutes a credible
system of dichotomous belief change.
