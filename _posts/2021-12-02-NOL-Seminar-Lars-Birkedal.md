Title: Iris: A Higher-Order Concurrent Separation Logic Framework

Speaker: Lars Birkedal, Professor of Computer Science at Aarhus University

Abstract: 

I will introduce some of our research on Iris, a higher-order concurrent
separation logic framework, implemented and verified in the Coq proof assistant,
which can be used for mathematical reasoning about safety and correctness of
concurrent higher-order imperative programs. Iris has been used for many
different applications; see iris-project.org for a list of research papers.
However, in this talk I will focus on the Iris base logic (and its semantics)
and sketch how one may define useful program logics on top of the base logic.
The base logic is a higher-order intuitionistic modal logic, which, in
particular, supports the definition of recursive predicates and whose type of
propositions is itself recursively defined.
