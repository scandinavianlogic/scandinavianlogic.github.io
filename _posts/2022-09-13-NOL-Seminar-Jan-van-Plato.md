[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

*Next talk*: Monday, September 26, 16.00-17.30 CEST (UTC+2), on Zoom (details

*Speaker*: Jan von Plato, University of Helsinki

*Title*: Gödel's work in logic and foundations in the light of his shorthand
notebooks

*Abstract*:  
The study of Gödel's shorthand notebooks in the ERC project GODELIANA has
revealed two main aspects of his work: First, there is behind each of his
relatively few published papers an enormous amount of notes. They typically
reveal how he arrived at his results, as with the incompleteness theorem. An
extreme case are Gödel's 1938 results on set theory, preceded by some 700 pages
of notes never studied before. Secondly, his threshold for publishing was by
1940 so high that some two thousand pages of developments and results remained
unknown. One highlight here is a series of notebooks titled "Resultate
Grundlagen" in which numerous anticipations of later results in set theory are
found. A second main topic are the relations between modal and intuitionistic
logic. In particular, Gödel gives a syntactic translation from S4 to
intuitionistic logic by methods that are readily generalizable to any decent
intermediate logics. These newly discovered methods are, even by today's
standards, a clear step ahead in the study of interrelations between systems of
non-classical logics.
