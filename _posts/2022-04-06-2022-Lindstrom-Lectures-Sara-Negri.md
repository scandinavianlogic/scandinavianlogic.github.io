After a two year hiatus, it is a great pleasure to announce the 2022 Lindström
Lectures will be given by Prof Sara Negri. The Lindström Lectures is an annual
lecture series established in 2013 to celebrate the singular achievements of Per
Lindström, former professor of logic at the department. As per tradition, Prof
Negri will give two lectures: a public lecture on Monday, 20 June and a research
lecture on Wednesday, 22 June. Both lectures will be held at the University of
Gothenburg (Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science).
Details of both talks below.

Attendance to both events is free.

### Public Lindström Lecture
Sara Negri (University of Genoa): *Syntax and semantics in synergy*  
Monday, 20 June 2022 at 18:00 to 20:00 (CEST)

Syntax and semantics, often considered as conflicting aspects of logic, have
turned out to be intertwined in a methodology for generating complete proof
systems for wide families of non-classical logics. In this formal semantics,
models can be considered as purely mathematical objects with no ontological
assumptions upon them. More specifically, by the “labelled formalism”, which now
is a well-developed methodology, the semantics is turned into an essential
component in the syntax of logical calculi. Thus enriched, the calculi not only
constitute a tool for the automatisation of reasoning, but can also be used at
the meta-level to establish general structural properties of logical systems and
direct proofs of completeness up to decidability in the terminating case. The
calculi, on the other hand, can be used to find simplified models through
conservativity results. The method will be illustrated with gradually
generalised semantics, including topological ones such as neighbourhood
semantics.

### Research Lindström Lecture
Sara Negri (University of Genoa): *On modal embeddings*
Wednesday, 22 June 2022 at 10:00 to 12:00 (CEST)  

Motivated by the difficulty in proving faithfulness of various modal embeddings
(starting with Gödel’s translation of intuitionistic logic into S4), we use
labelled calculi to obtain simple and uniform faithfulness proofs for the
embedding of intermediate logics into their modal companions, and of
intuitionistic logic into provability logic, including extensions to infinitary
logics.
