EXTENDED DEADLINE: 6TH JULY 2025

<https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/pc25.php>

This year's international autumn school "Proof and Computation" will be held
from 14th to 20th September 2025 at Haus der bayerischen Landwirtschaft in
Herrsching near Munich. Its aim is to bring together young researchers in the
fields of Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science and Philosophy.

### SCOPE
* Predicative Foundations
* Constructive Mathematics and Type Theory
* Computation in Higher Types
* Extraction of Programs from Proofs

### COURSES

* Ulrich Berger (Swansea): Program extraction in higher-order logic
* Roberto Giuntini (Cagliari): From Sharp to Unsharp: Exploring the Frontiers of Quantum Logic
* Hajime Ishihara (Toho-University, Ota City): Uniform Spaces and Integration Theory
* Klaus Mainzer (Munich): From Proof and Computation to AI
* Dirk Pattinson (Canberra): Proof Systems for non-monotone modal logics
* Hideki Tsuiki (Kyoto): Extracting nondeterministic programs from proofs (slot 1) Fractals and coinduction (slots 2 and 3)
* Richard Zach (Calgary): Introduction to the Epsilon-Calculus

### WORKING GROUPS

There will be an opportunity to form ad-hoc groups working on specific projects,
but also to discuss in more general terms the vision of constructing correct
programs from proofs.

### HOW TO GET THERE

The default arrival time is Sunday afternoon, and departure time Saturday after
breakfast.  There are frequent suburban trains (line S8) from the airport and
downtown Munich to Herrsching.  From the train station in Herrsching one can
walk to the school site; see its website for directions. There is also a bus
connection.

### APPLICATIONS

Graduate or PhD students and young postdoctoral researches are invited to apply.
Applications (e.g. a self-introduction including research interests and
motivation) should be sent to

Valentin Herrmann [herrmann+pc25@math.lmu.de](mailto:herrmann+pc25@math.lmu.de).

Students are required to provide a letter of recommendation, preferably from the
thesis adviser.

Deadline (extended) for applications: 6th July 2025

Applicants will be notified by 25th July 2025 (new date).

### FINANCIAL SUPPORT

The workshop is supported by the Udo Keller Stiftung (Hamburg).  Successful
applicants with funding problems may apply for financial support covering
accommodation including meals for the days of the autumn school (ca. 145 Euro
per day).
