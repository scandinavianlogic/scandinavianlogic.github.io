[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Date**: Monday,  25 March 2024 at 16:00 CET (UTC+1) on Zoom  
**Speaker:** Albert Visser, Professor of Logic at Utrecht University  
**Title:** Restricted Sequential Theories  

**Abstract:**  
Sequential theories form a fundamental class of theories in logic. They have
full coding possibilities and allow us to build partial satisfaction predicates
for formulas of bounded depth-of-quantifier-alernations. In many respects, they
are the proper domain of GÃ¶delian metamathematics. We explain the notion of
sequential theory.

A theory is restricted if it can be axiomatised by axioms of bounded
depth-of-quantifier-alernations. All finitely axiomatised theories are
restriced, but, for example, also Primitive Recursive Arithmetic. We explain the
small-is-very-small principle for restricted sequential theories which says
that, whenever the given theory shows that a definable property has a small
witness, i.e., a witness in a sufficiently small definable cut, then it shows
that the property has a very small witness, i.e., a witness below a given
standard number.

We sketch two proofs that restricted theories are incomplete (however complex
the axiom set). One uses the small-is-very-small principle and the other a
direct Rosser argument. (The second argument was developed in collaboration with
Ali Enayat.)
