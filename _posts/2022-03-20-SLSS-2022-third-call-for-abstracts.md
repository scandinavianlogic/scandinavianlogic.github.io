The eleventh Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLSS 2022) will be held at the
University of Bergen, Norway, during 17-19 June, 2022, under the auspices of the
Scandinavian Logic Society. The [previous three meetings](../symposium.html) of
the SLSS were held in Gothenburg in Sweden (2018), Tampere in Finland (2014) and
Roskilde in Denmark (2012).

The primary aim of the Symposium is to promote research in the field of logic
(broadly conceived) carried out in research communities in Scandinavia.
Moreover, it warmly invites the participation of logicians from all over the
world. The meeting will include invited lectures and a forum for participants to
present contributed talks.

SLSS 2022 is being planned as a physical-attendance event. Still, we keep
monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic situation, to make adjustments if they are
needed.
