[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Title** Possible and impossible conditionals for logics based on team semantics

**Abstract**  
Team semantics is a semantic framework originally introduced by Hodges (1997)
for the study of dependence and independence concepts, and later systematically
developed by Väänänen (2007). It is also independently adopted in inquisitive
logic by Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011). In team semantics, formulas are
evaluated with respect to sets of evaluation points, called teams, rather than
single evaluation points as in standard semantics. 

Logics based on team semantics are typically extensions of classical logic and
thus inherit classical implication over classical formulas. However, the
earliest versions of team-based logic, such as independence-friendly logic and
dependence logic, do not include a conditional connective for arbitrary
formulas. An adequate conditional, known as intuitionistic implication, was
proposed for dependence logic by Abramsky and Väänänen (2009). This connective
is also part of the syntax of inquisitive logic. Intuitionistic implication
behaves well in these downward closed logics, in the sene that it preserves
downward closure and satisfies both Modus Ponens and the Deduction Theorem.

In recent years, many variants of dependence logic with different closure
properties have been introduced, including union closed and convex logics. In
these settings, the intuitionistic implication no longer behaves well, as it
either fails to preserve the relevant closure property or fails to satisfy the
Deduction Theorem. In this talk, we show that this failure is unavoidable: these
logics cannot be enriched with any conditional connective that simultaneously
preserves the closure property and satisfies both Modus Ponens and the Deduction
Theorem.

This is joint work with Fausto Barbero.
