title: "PhD position in theory and applications of dependence logic, Helsinki"
tags: [position]
---
The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki
invites applications for a three-year doctoral student position (with a
possibility of extension if further funding can be obtained later) in a research
project on “Logical analysis of no-go theorems in social choice and quantum
foundations”. This multidisciplinary project aims to apply the methodology of
dependence logic to develop formal connections between no-go theorems in social
choice theory (such as Arrow’s Theorem) and in quantum foundations (such as
Bell’s Theorem). The project will also address relevant open problems in the
theory of dependence logic.

The starting date of this position is September 1, 2019, or earlier by
agreement. Applicants are expected to hold a Master’s degree in mathematics,
computer science, philosophy or some other relevant subject by the time of the
start date. An ideal candidate should have a strong background in mathematical
logic, and a keen interest in interdisciplinary research.
