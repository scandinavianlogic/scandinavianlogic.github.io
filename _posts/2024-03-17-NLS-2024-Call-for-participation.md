The Nordic Logic Summer School (NLS) and Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLSS) are
respectively
[the Summer School](/summer-school.html) and
[the Symposium](/symposium.html)
organized by the Scandinavial Logic Society. This year, both events will take
place this June 2024 in Reykjavik, Iceland. NLS will take place from June 10 to
13, and SLSS from June 14 to 16.

The intended audience for NLS is advanced master students, PhD-students,
postdocs and experienced researchers wishing to learn the state of the art in a
particular subject. As usual, this year we have an exciting lineup of five
lecturers on a wide spectrum of topics.

Lecturers:  
- Jandson Ribeiro (Philosophical logic)
- Sandra Kiefer (Learning and logic)
- Miika Hannula (Model theory)
- Greg Restall (Proof theory)
- Rineke Verbrugge (Logic, CS and AI)
