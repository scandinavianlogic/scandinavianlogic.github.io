[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Date** Monday, 25 September 2023 at 16:00 CEST (UTC+2) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Thomas Bolander (Professor in logic and AI at DTU Compute,
Technical University of Denmark)  
**Title** Epistemic Planning: Logical formalism, computational complexity, and robotic implementations  

**Abstract**  
Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) can be used as a formalism for agents to represent
the mental states of other agents: their beliefs and knowledge, and potentially
even their plans and goals. Hence, the logic can be used as a formalism to give
agents, e.g. robots, a Theory of Mind, allowing them to take the perspective of
other agents. In my research, I have combined DEL with techniques from automated
planning in order to describe a theory of what I call Epistemic Planning:
planning where agents explicitly reason about the mental states of others. The
talk will introduce epistemic planning based on DEL, address issues of
computational complexity, and demonstrate applications in cognitive robotics and
human-robot collaboration.
