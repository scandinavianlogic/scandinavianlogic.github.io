### Information

These positions are at the
[mathematics department](https://www.su.se/department-of-mathematics/)
at Stockholm University. Here follows some information from
[Anders MÃ¶rtberg](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/),
associate professor and member of the department's logic group.

Please help spread the word to students who are interested in doing a PhD on
type theory, HoTT, computer formalization of CS and math, constructive
mathematics, etc. Note that PhD students here are employed with a salary and
that the position comes with benefits. There are also no tuition fees.

If you are a student interested in doing a PhD with me you are welcome to apply
to both positions above, just make sure you apply to the one in Computational
Mathematics as that is the division I formally belong to. Please also specify
clearly that you want me as an advisor in your application (e.g. in your cover
letter). Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
