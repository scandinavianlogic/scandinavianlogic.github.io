**Speaker** Phokion Kolaitis (Distinguished Research Professor, UC Santa Cruz and Principal Research Staff Member, IBM Almaden Research Center)  
**Title** Possible Worlds and Certain Answers

**Abstract**  
Databases are typically assumed to have definite content so that users can pose
queries and retrieve unambiguous answers. It is often the case, however, that a
database may contain information that is incomplete, inconsistent, or uncertain.
Possible world semantics provides meaning to logic-based queries on databases
suffering from these deficiencies. Such databases are viewed as compact
representations of all their possible rectifications; by definition, the certain
answers are the query answers that hold true in every possible rectification of
a deficient database.

The goal of this lecture is to provide an overview of some of the work on
certain answers as a unifying framework for coping with incompleteness,
inconsistency, and uncertainty in databases. Case studies include inconsistent
databases, probabilistic databases, and election databases in social choice
theory.
