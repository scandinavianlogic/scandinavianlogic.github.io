**Date**: Monday,  26 February 2024 at 16:00 CET (UTC+1) on Zoom  
**Speaker:** Lauri Hella, Professor at the Faculty of Information Technology and
Communication Sciences, Tampere University  
**Title:** Game characterizations for the number of quantifiers  

**Abstract**  
A game that characterizes definability of classes of structures by first-order
sentences containing a given number of quantifiers was introduced by Immerman
in 1981. In this talk I describe two other games that are equivalent with the
Immerman game in the sense that they characterize definability by a given number
of quantifiers.

In the Immerman game, Duplicator has a canonical optimal strategy, and hence
Duplicator can be completely removed from the game by replacing her moves with
default moves given by this optimal strategy. On the other hand, in the other
two games there is no such optimal strategy for Duplicator. Thus, the Immerman
game can be regarded as a one-player game, but the other two games are genuine
two-player games.

The talk is based on joint work with Kerkko Luosto.
