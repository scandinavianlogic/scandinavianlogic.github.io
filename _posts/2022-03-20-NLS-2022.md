Nordic Logic Summer School 2022  
University of Bergen, Norway, June 13-16, 2022

The fourth
[Nordic Logic Summer School](https://scandinavianlogic2020.w.uib.no/fourth-nordic-logic-summer-school-nls-2020/)
is arranged under the auspices of the Scandinavian Logic Society. The three
[previous schools](../summer-school.html) were organised in Nordfjordeid, Norway
(2013), Helsinki, Finland (2015) and Stockholm, Sweden (2017). The intended
audience is advanced master students, PhD-students, postdocs and experienced
researchers wishing to learn the state of the art in a particular subject. It
will be held between June 13th and 16th. It is likely that there will be student
poster session on June 17th, possibly augmented by other student events. Five
courses will be offered. No parallel sessions are planned, so it will be
possible to attend them all.
