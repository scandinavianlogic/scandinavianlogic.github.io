[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

**Date** Monday, 21 October, 2024 at 16:00 (UTC+2) on Zoom  
**Speaker** Åsa Hirvonen (University lecturer, University of Helsinki  
**Title** Looking at quantum mechanics with model theoretic glasses

**Abstract**  
The axioms of quantum mechanics present the state of a quantum system as a unit
vector in complex Hilbert space. However, when Dirac [1] presented his bra- and
ket-vectors, he had a more general space in mind. Schwartz [4] later gave a
rigorous account for Dirac's "vectors" as distributions, but in elementary
physics books one still encounters presentations where ket-vectors are presented
just as elements of a Hilbert space, and treated with methods from
finite-dimensional linear algebra.

During the last years Tapani Hyttinen and I [2,3] have been looking at various
models justifying the finite dimensional approaches from such textbooks. Our
approaches are based on various embeddings of a Hilbert space into metric
ultraproducts of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this talk I will present
the basic ideas, their benefits and limitations. Time permitting, I will also
contrast our approach to Boris Zilber's work on the same questions, that was the
original inspiration for us.
