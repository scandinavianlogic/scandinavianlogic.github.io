[Mathematics education and research at Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en/math)
are hosted by
[the Computing Sciences unit](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/computing-sciences)
and the
[Faculty of Information Technology and Communications](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/faculty-information-technology-and-communication-sciences).
We conduct strong research in the areas of mathematics including  
- Applications of algebraic topology
- Inverse problems
- Mathematical logic
- Mathematical systems theory and functional analysis

Our personnel consists of 5 professors, 15 lecturers/instructors, and roughly 30
research staff members including post-doctoral researchers and doctoral
students. To complement and strengthen our research profile, we invite
applications for an Assistant/Associate/Full Professor in Discrete Mathematics
(Tenure Track). We are especially seeking candidates with an excellent track
record in the area of mathematical logic. Expertise on applications is
considered an additional strength.

The successful candidate is expected to lead world-class scientific research and
to demonstrate their potential in securing substantial research funding. They
will also participate in teaching and supervision of students in the area of
mathematical logic.  We are seeking an active member to our academic community
and value potential for local research collaboration. The more detailed
tenure-track objectives will be set based on the level and previous experience
of the candidate.
