Title: Semiring Semantics for Logical Statements with Applications to the
Strategy Analysis of Games

Speaker: Erich Grädel, Professor of Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science
at RWTH Aachen University

Abstract:  
Semiring semantics of logical formulae generalises the classical Boolean
semantics by permitting multiple truth values  from certain semirings. In the
classical Boolean semantics, a model of a formula assigns to each (instantiated)
literal a Boolean value. K-interpretations, for a semiring K, generalize this by
assigning to each such literal a value from K. We then interpret 0 as false and
all other semiring values as nuances of true, which provide additional
information, depending on the semiring. For example, the Boolean semiring over
{0,1} corresponds classical semantics, the Viterbi-semiring can model confidence
scores, the tropical semiring is used for cost analysis, and min-max-semirings
(A, max, min, a, b) for a totally ordered set (A,<) can model different access
levels. Most importantly, semirings of polynomials, such as N[X], allow us to
track certain literals by mapping them to different indeterminates. The overall
value of the formula is then a polynomial that describes precisely what
combinations of literals prove the truth of the formula.
