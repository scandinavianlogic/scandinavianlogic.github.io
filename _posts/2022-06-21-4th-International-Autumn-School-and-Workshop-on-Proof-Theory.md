The 4th International Autumn School on Proof Theory in Utrecht is arranged under
the auspices of The Proof Society and organised by the universities of Amsterdam
and Utrecht. The Proof Society has recently been formed to support the notion of
proof in its broadest sense, through a series of suitable activities; to be
therefore inclusive in reaching out to all scientific areas which consider proof
as an object in their studies; to enable the community to shape its future by
identifying, formulating and communicating its most important goals; to actively
promote proof to increase its visibility and representation.

The aim of the Autumn school is to cover basic and advanced topics in proof
theory. The focus of the fourth edition will be computational content of proofs,
sequent calculi, proof complexity, proof theory of set theory, and philosophical
aspects of proof. Other areas will be represented through research talks at the
following workshop. The intended audience is advanced master students, PhD
students, postdocs and experienced researchers in mathematics, computer science
and philosophy.

The Autumn school is co-located with a workshop on proof theory in Utrecht
(11–12 November). We invite proposals for contributed talks at the workshop.
These can be on published or unpublished work, as well as work in progress. The
best talk presented by a student will receive an award from The Proof Society.
