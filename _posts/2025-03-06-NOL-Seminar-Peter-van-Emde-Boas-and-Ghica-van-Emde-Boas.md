**Speakers** Peter van Emde Boas (Professor, University of Amsterdam) and Ghica van Emde Boas (Independent Scholar)  
**Title** Analyzing the Logic of Sun Tzu in “The Art of War”, using Mind Maps

**Abstract**  
Sun Tzu was a military strategist who lived in China about 2500 years ago. His
book is still popular today, especially in business circles.

This talk presents a study of “The Art of War” from the perspectives of logic,
mathematics, and computer science. We explain briefly what a mind map is and our
strict text tree interpretation of it, for the purpose of analyzing Sun Tzu’s
text. We show that you can improve the translation and find more meaning in the
text, representing the text as mind maps. If time permits, we will illustrate
that, surprisingly, the text still helps us to understand what is happening in
warfare today.

The title of this talk is also the title of our book, co-authored by Kaibo Xie
(Tsinghua Univ. Beijing), and Bonan Zhao (Univ. of Edinburgh), and published in
2022 by Springer. The book is the result of a joint study of the Institute of
Language, Logic and Computation, Univ. of Amsterdam and the Institute for
Philosophy, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.
