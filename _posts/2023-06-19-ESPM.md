title: "European Society for the Philosophy of Mathematics"
---
In the last few years the European community of Philosophy of Mathematics has
grown considerably in number and maturity. With the aim of giving a clearer and
more structured perspective to young scholars, the European Society for the
Philosophy of Mathematics
([ESPM](https://philmath.eu/))
has recently been  founded (more information about the board can be found
[here](https://philmath.eu/board/)).

The mission of the ESPM is to foster the study and research in the Philosophy of
Mathematics and to coordinate the activities of the national communities.
Towards this goal, the ESPM organizes an international conference and a summer
school.

The first, inaugural,
[conference](https://philmath.eu/2023conference/)
of the ESPM will take place at Kingâ€™s College in London on the 5-7 September
2023.

If you are interested in joining the ESPM, it is easy: just follow the
instructions contained in the
