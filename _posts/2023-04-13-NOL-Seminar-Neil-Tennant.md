**Date**: Monday, 24 April 2023 at 16:00 CEST (UTC+2), over Zoom  
**Speaker:**  Neil Tennant, Distinguished Professor in Philosophy, College of
Arts & Sciences, The Ohio State University  
**Title:** It's All or Nothing─Explosion v. Implosion  

**Abstract**  
We set out five basic requirements for a logical system to be
adequate for the regimentation of deductive reasoning in mathematics and
science. We raise the question whether there are any further requirements, not
entailed by these five, that ought to be imposed. One possible reply is
dismissed: that the logical system should allow one to infer any proposition at
all from an inconsistent set---i.e., it should have as primitive, or allow one
to derive, the rule Ex Falso Quodlibet. We then propose that the logic should be
implosive: it should not allow an inconsistent set to have any consequences
other than absurdity. This proposal may appear to be very radical; but we hope
to show that it is robust against objections.
