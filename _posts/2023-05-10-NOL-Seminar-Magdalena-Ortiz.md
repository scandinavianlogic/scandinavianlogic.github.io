[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

and Reasoning, Ume√• University)  
**Title:** A Short Introduction to SHACL for Logicians  

**Abstract**  
The SHACL Shapes Constraint Language was recommended in 2017 by the W3C for
describing constraints on web data (specifically, on RDF graphs) and validating
them. At first glance, it may not seem to be a topic for logicians, but as it
turns out, SHACL can be approached as a formal logic, and actually quite an
interesting one. In this paper, we give a brief introduction to SHACL tailored
towards logicians and frame key uses of SHACL as familiar logic reasoning tasks.
We discuss how SHACL relates to description logics, which are the basis of the
OWL Web Ontology Languages, a related yet orthogonal standard for web data.
Finally, we summarize some of our recent work in the SHACL world, hoping that
this may shed light on how ideas, results, and techniques from well-established
areas of logic can advance the state of the art in this emerging field.
