[The Nordic Online Logic Seminar](/the-NOL-seminar.html)
is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for
the broader logic community. The seminar is open for professional or aspiring
logicians and logic aficionados worldwide. If you wish to receive the Zoom ID

Next talk: Monday, February 28, 16.00-17.30 CET (UTC+1), on Zoom (details are
provided to the seminar subscribers)

Title: Formalization of Mathematics and Dependent Type Theory

Speaker: Thierry Coquand, professor in computer science at the University of
Gothenburg, Sweden

Abstract:

The first part will be about representation of mathematics on a computer.
Questions that arise there are  naturally reminiscent of issues that arise when
teaching formal proofs in a basic logic course, e.g. how to deal with free  and
bound variables, and instantiation rules. As discussed in a 1962 paper of
Tarski, these issues are "clearly experienced both in teaching an elementary
course in mathematical logic and in formalizing the syntax of predicate logic
for some theoretical purposes." I will present two quite different approaches to
this problem: one inspired by Tarski's paper (N. Megill, system Metamath) and
one using dependent type theory (N.G. de Bruijn).

The second part will then try to explain how notations introduced by dependent
type theory suggest new insights for old questions coming from Principia
Mathematica (extensionality, reducibility axiom) through the notion of universe,
introduced by Grothendieck for representing category theory in set theory, and
introduced in dependent type theory by P. Martin-LÃ¶f.
